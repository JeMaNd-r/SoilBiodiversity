Overview,Hypotheses,Hypotheses,"Earthworms are shown to be driven by climatic, topographic, habitat and edaphic factors (Mueller et al. 2016, Phillips et al. 2019). The main drivers of earthworm distribution are (1) soil moisture, which is related to the availability of water through precipitation and can also be expressed as aridity (proportion of precipitation to evapotranspiration), (2) chemical and physical soil properties, such as pH, cation and heavy metal concentrations as well as soil texture, but also (3) the amount of organic carbon in soil that serves as resource for earthworms. In addition, (4) topographic factors were shown to drive large-scale distribution of many organisms including earthworms (Phillips et al. 2019).

We included the following variables to represent climatic factors: Aridity Index, Mean annual precipitation (MAP), and Precipitation seasonality (MAP_seas), Mean annual temperature (MAT), Temperature seasonality (MAT_seas), mean of the yearly Nitrogen deposition (Nit_Depo), and Snow cover (i.e., number of days with snow cover). 
As habitat factors, we decided on the proportion of area covered by different land-use types, namely Agriculture, Forest, Pastures, and Shrubland. In addition, we included Distance to urban areas, Land fragmentation, and Population Density in our models. To account for topographic factors, we included Elevation, Aspect (i.e., direction of a slope), Slope, Latitude, as well as Distance to coast, and Distance to rivers. Finally, edaphic factors are depicted by Cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil texture expressed as Clay+Silt content, concentration of Copper (Cu), Mercury (Hg), Nitrogen (N), and Phosphorus (P), as well as pH in H20, and content of Soil organic carbon (SOC)."

Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,"For species with at least 100 records (i.e., present in at least 100 2 km² grid cells), we performed BIOMOD ensemble modeling using all 10 available algorithms to estimate average probability of presence (TSS as evaluation criteria)."
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"Prior to model building, we standardized all predictor variables and used variance inflation (VIF) analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients to avoid highly correlated variables. We only included the top ten most important (MaxEnt pre-analysis) and weakly correlated (VIF<10, Pearson correlation>0.8) variables. 
Model fitting was done automatically as much as possible. In addition, we generated individual background data for the models to increase their performances. Predictive model performance was assessed using TSS, AUC(ROC), and Kappa."

Data,Biodiversity data,Clipping,"We clipped all data to the political boundary of Europe including 13 additional countries (Albania, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Great Britain, Iceland, Kosovo, Mazedonia, Moldawia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and Ukraine)."
Data,Biodiversity data,Scaling,Spatial thinning: We defined presence/absence in each 2x2 km grid cell across Europe based on the respective occurrence records per species using ArcGIS (Zonal Statistics) and R (terra::rasterize()).
Data,Biodiversity data,Cleaning,Data filtering: Earthworm species that had less than 10 occurrence records were excluded from the modeling. Earthworm species that had less than 100 occurrence records were excluded from the species richness modeling. We excluded records before 1970 and checked for spatial bias in occurrence coordinates using the R package CoordinateCleaner. More information can be found in the main text.
Data,Biodiversity data,Absence data,No true absence data were used.
Data,Biodiversity data,Background data,"We generated 10,000 random background points within the study area per species using the R package biomod2. We followed advice from Barbet-Massin et al. 2012 to calculate model-specific background data that were shown to increase predictive performance."
Data,Biodiversity data,Errors and biases,"Occurrence data have been collected using different sampling effort and methodology leading to potential errors because of detection probability, sampling coverage, and sampling depth (e.g., soil cores of 10cm vs. deeper sampling strategies using extraction solutions). Spatial bias: certain countries were sampled more in depth than other countries (e.g. Germany or Great Britain vs. Poland), but there have also been differences in sampling intensity within countries (e.g., low intensity in Italy vs. high in France vs. clustered sampling in Spain). Temporal bias: occurrences were recorded between 1970 and 2022 (mean: 2004, median: 2007), that may include climate variation and land-use changes. We accounted for temporal changes by weighing more recent records stronger in our models."

Seven climatic variables: aridity index, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and precipitation seasonality (MAP_seas), mean annual temperature (MAT), temperature seasonality (MAT_seas), mean of the yearly nitrogen deposition (Nit_Depo), and snow cover (i.e., number of days with snow cover). Seven habitat factors: four land-use types (agriculture, forest, pastures, and shrubland), distance to urban areas, land fragmentation, and population density in our models. Six topographic variables: elevation, aspect (i.e., direction of a slope), slope, latitude, as well as distance to coast, and distance to rivers. And nine edaphic factors: cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil texture expressed as clay+silt content, concentration of copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), and phosphorus (P), as well as pH in H20, content of soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil temperature at 0-5 cm depth (SoilT)."
